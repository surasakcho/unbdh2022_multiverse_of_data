  - I decided to share a subset of submitted codes mainly from my contributions, which is downloading and processing satellite data as well as rice cultivation pixels classifer model.
  - For anyone interested in using Satellite data (especially MODIS' NDVI) to monitor crop production, please check to 'modis_ndvi' directory.
  - In this directory, there are several 'ipynb' files. To make it easy to follow, I named file to indicate the sequence of workflow.
  - More explanation of codes are available as comments with in each file.
  - If revealing more details and codes of the whole work is possible, hopefully, I will come back and publish more.
